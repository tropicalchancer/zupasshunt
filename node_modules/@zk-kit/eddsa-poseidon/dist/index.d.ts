 * This process involves hashing the private key with Blake1, pruning the resulting hash to retain the lower 32 bytes,

 * process by omitting steps 1, 2, and 3 as outlined in RFC 8032 section 5.1.5, enhancing circuit efficiency and simplicity.
 * This method is crucial for fixed-base scalar multiplication operations within the correspondent cryptographic circuit.
 * For detailed steps, see: {@link https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.5}.
 * For example usage in a circuit, see: {@link https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/2c144fc9e55b30ad09474aeafa763c4115338409/packages/circuits/semaphore.circom#L21}

 * If you want to pass a bigint, a number or a hexadecimal, be sure to convert them to one of the supported types first.
